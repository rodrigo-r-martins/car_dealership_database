Car Dealership Database - Team of 3

CS623 (Database Management Systems) team project

The team was assigned to design and develop a database to enable a car dealership to manage its business.

We had to complete 8 chapters which includes creating forms, creating database dictionary, design the ER diagram as a model for the database, developing the database using MySQL/Oracle, using the database to query reports using SQL, creating triggers, granting privileges to users, creating audit trail triggers and planning the distribution of the database.
